<h2 id="heading">The Jetson Nano Returns!</h2>
I was looking at the statistics on my Google Search Console, and I realized that my top Google queries were all about the Jetson Nano, even though it's nearly one of my oldest posts. So, to humor all of the jetson lovers, I'm gonna go back to it and see if anything has changed, gotten better, gotten worse, etc. I'll get into the real reason I'm doing this later.
