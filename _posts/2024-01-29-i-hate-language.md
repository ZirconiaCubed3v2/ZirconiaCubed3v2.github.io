&emsp;Let me just say, when I say I hate spanish, it's not a racist thing, I don't hate the people, I hate their language. And I don't hate just spanish either, I hate english too. The sheer number of rules combined with the many exceptions to each rule is insane, and even being a fluent speaker of english, I'm constantly learning of new rules and new exceptions to those rules, which I hate. I also hate that I have to take two years of spanish to graduate high school. I have always loved language and have tried learning a lot of different languages like russian, italian, swedish, even klingon (all through duolingo of course), but I gave up each time because they interfered with my required spanish class. I have to wait until next year when I don't have to take a language class until I can really start learning swedish (yes, I'm going to continue with swedish, i like it very much). I'm not gonna make this post too long, just needed a little rant after my abysmal performance on a spoken spanish test about imperfect and preterite.
