<h2 id="heading">Firefox is Now the Worst Browser Ever</h2>

They also removed the part about not sharing data from their Terms of Use, which means they will almost certainly share your data. All the time. To everyone.  
Firefox used to be my most used browser because I run various versions of Linux on all my home computers, but now I apparently have to find something else to use, and I urge you to as well if you also used Firefox. I find it ridiculous that they force a _royalty-free_ license on every little bit of data that gets put into Firefox (yes i would be fine with a royalty license, i like money too). As user *crlsktr* on the Mozilla Discourse forums put so eloquently,

This sums up the situation perfectly.  
If you need some alternate browsers for Linux, I personally use <a href="https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ungoogled-chromium</a>, which is a version of chromium that has been, as you can expect, de-googled. But it still runs the chromium framework, so services like Grafana still support it.  
All of the information on this post was taken from the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Firefox Terms of Use</a> and a <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/why-does-mozilla-now-require-a-nonexclusive-royalty-free-worldwide-license-when-entering-information-in-firefox/140700" target="_blank" ref="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla Discourse post by user rugkx</a> highlighting the change.
