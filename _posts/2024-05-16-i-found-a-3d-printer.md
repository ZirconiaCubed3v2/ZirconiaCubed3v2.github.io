&emsp;I recently got a 3d printer, or rather set one up that I already had, but long neglected to use because it was under a pile of stuff, covered in dust. I wanted to make some stuff for a project, so I made it out of cardboard, but then I remembered I had that guy sitting in the corner, so I pulled it out, cleaned it up, and started printing. It's an early model of the Creality CR-6 SE, which has an unfortunate error in the motherboard which will fry both the printer and the computer if it's plugged in with usb, so I can't do that, but the SD card works just fine. I also have to get re-acquainted with Fusion 360, because I haven't used it in years, and the learning curve is very steep. I printed some covers with attachements for my calculator, a stand for my juniper ex2300 switch which sits on my desk, and a headphones holder that clamps onto the side of my desk. I also designed something of my own: a funnel for the vent out of our server closet, which worked first try, and incredibly well for something designed by me. Anyway, I will be using the printer for my next big project, which should be done soon. Here's a little hint as to what it is: HP Stream 7 Tablet.
