So I uploaded <a style="text-decoration:underline;" href="https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/EvilAppleJuice-ESP32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EvilAppleJuice</a> to my ESP32, and it started shutting people's iPhones off because they get overloaded with various BLE beacon notifications. I love watching people panic as they realize their phones aren't responding anymore, and won't force shutdown either. I actually noticed a change in the people as they ate lunch: they were talking to each other more and on their phones less, because they knew it would eventually shut down. At least, that's what I think, it might be for some other reason, or there might be the same exact number of people on their phones as there are normally. If you want to do the same, just build the project with PlatformIO using the Visual Studio Code extension or the cli, and then upload it, and have fun. I do want to make some modifications, though.  
  
If I can manage to capture the byte sequences of BLE beacon notifications on android devices like Samsungs and LGs, then I might be able to build those into the code, and it'll affect those devices as well, which would be a lot more fun. I've even made it into some people's Instagram posts talking about iPhones randomly freezing all day. A lot of people ask me why I do the things I do, and here's the answer: Sheer boredom and the anonymous glory that comes with seeing people make wrong assumptions about problems I caused, and not getting into any trouble for doing it.
