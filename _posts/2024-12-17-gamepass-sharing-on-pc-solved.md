Soooo, forgot about the news (like usual) but I have an emergency post for something I finally figured out last night: Game Pass sharing on PC (win11). This has been bugging me for so long, and I never found any solid answers on Microsoft forums or anything. But I have the answer now and would like to share it to other people.

You need two Microsoft accounts for this. One subscribed to any tier of Game Pass, Account A, and an account that doesn't have Game Pass, Account B. First, sign into the Xbox app and the Microsoft store with Account B. Then, install the Game Pass games using the Xbox app. If you get redirected to a page asking you to subscribe to Game Pass, make sure you signed into the Microsoft store with Account A correctly. Then, when the games are installed, sign into the Xbox app and the Microsoft store with Account B, and you should be able to play the previously-installed Game Pass games, but as Account B, which does not own Game Pass.

It is a very simple process, but it took me so long to figure this out, and apparently nobody says that _anywhere_ on the internet (that I could find). No idea why.

I will now take a brief hiatus to finish Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,
