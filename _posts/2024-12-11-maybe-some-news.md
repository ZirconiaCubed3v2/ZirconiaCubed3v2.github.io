&emsp;As is evident by the dates of my posts, I don't actually write said posts very often. And I would like to change that. So, I am changing how I do these. Once a week, I will be doing a 'news' article, talking about interesting tech news and things that people should know about, such as the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/ryzen-9800x3d-burned-chips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exploding 9800X3Ds</a>.  

&emsp;That's it, I'm done talking now. The first news post will be on friday of this week (12/13, or 13/12 for you british folk).

Hopefully I actually start using this website I so meticulously created,
