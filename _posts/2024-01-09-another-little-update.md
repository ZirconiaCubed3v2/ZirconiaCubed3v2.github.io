title: "Just a Little Update"
date: 2024-01-09

I have to remember to do these blog posts, because if I don't it will just be another dead project, and that's the last thing I need for anyone to see: my lack of commitment. Anyway, here's another little update for you to (hopefully) read:
<br>
<h3 id="heading">Calculator</h3>
I rebuilt the calculator, this time securing everything with command strips for mounting picture frames, rather than poorly sticking electrical tape and hairties. I also put everything on the case of the calculator instead of directly on the back, so I can remove the heavy add-on stuff and just have the base calculaor for stuff like classwork and tests, because I'm pretty sure I would not be allowed to use a calculator with a bunch of extra electronics strapped to it.

<h3 id="heading">ESP32 Shenanigans</h3>
I managed to upload <a href="https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/EvilAppleJuice-ESP32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EviAppleJuice</a> to my calculator, with some difficulty because all the different esp32 models have different build tools. But I got it uploaded, and just the first day, phones were shutting off right and left, and people across the campus were talking about these strange pop-ups. I would call that a complete and total success.

<h3 id="heading">Manjaro is The Best</h3>
Manjaro is now my new favorite linux distro and OS period, mainly because it has the DIY-feel of Arch without the need to do _everything_ yourself, like in Arch. In Manjaro, what I want to do myself I can do myself, but everything I don't want to do myself I can leave as it is, because it is most likely already handled by default. For example, I have the compromise of KDE Plasma, a beautiful window manager, but I can also configure custom shortcuts like in Awesome WM, without having to do all the extra configuration and headaches that come with installing Awesome.

I can't promise a stable post schedule,
