&emsp;I got covid for the second time, and I first tested positive about a week ago. I haven't been posting or doing much of anything for obvious reasons, meaning I was quarantined to my room all day for the past week with only my useless locked-down phone, my switch (lite) and my old (also pretty locked down) kindle fire. Yeah. It wasn't exactly paradise in there. I was drugged up half the time on tylenol AND ibuprofen, yes both, so I wasn't feeling too bad, but being locked up got very old very fast. I watched James May's new 'Our Man In...' series about India, which was nice but it was only 3 episodes this time. I completed Breath of the Wild on my switch and completely overprepared for it, gathering and cooking lots of super-powerful stat-boosting food, of which I only used 3, and I filled my inventory with the strongest weapons, shields, bows, etc that I could find, and didn't even break any of them. The entire boss fight (including dark beast ganon) took me 7 minutes to finish. I also started One Piece, and after being released from my room for testing negative twice in a row, I'm on episode 62, which I'd say is a pretty good dent in it. I got my esp32s3, and I'm gonna get some more little esp32-based toys, one that needs an antenna to run, another that has a screen (it's gonna be very fun when it all gets here).

Glad to be out of isolation,
