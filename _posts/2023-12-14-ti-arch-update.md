So the project didn't die on the first day, which is good,
because that usually happens with the projects I make.
So here's an update on some of the things that have been
happening:

<h3 id="heading">Exams:</h3>
I am almost 100% sure I haven't scored over an 80% on
any of my semester exams, which is fine, I guess I didn't
really *need* to pass any of those classes.

<h3 id="heading">Calculator:</h3>
TI-Arch is going pretty good, the usb hub works, but
a big problem is that the kernel doesn't support
SHA-1, and I am not rebuilding the kernel, so there's
not gonna be any wifi adapter support. But hope is
not over for network access, because I could still try
to get a usb ethernet adapter connected and access the
internet that way.

<h3 id="heading">The Blog Itself:</h3>
I have no idea how to make a blog, especially the fact
that all these pages are written in markdown. I have
no idea how to use markdown past the basic things
like the headings and italics and bolds. They say
you can use html tags to spice things up, but I'm
pretty skeptical about whether Hugo will like that
or not.

<h3 id="heading">Final Notes:</h3>
Not much has happened in the past few days, but I
hope this blog doesn't sound nearly as boring
to other people as it does to me.
